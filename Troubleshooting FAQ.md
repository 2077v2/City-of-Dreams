## The Camera is locked i cant move up or down❓

This is a bug everyone has had for a long time with the third person mode there is a simple but inconvenient fix. When the camera lock happens 

1) Activate 3rd person with "1"

2) Deactivate third person with "1"

Now the camera should be unlocked

Alternatively you can disable the mod through the in game mod menus. 

1) Select Mods from the main menu 

2) Toggle off third person mode.
