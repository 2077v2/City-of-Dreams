2) Go to where cyberpunk2077 is installed and delete these 4 folders /**bin** / **engine** / **r6** / **red4ext**

This is a bug everyone has had for a long time with the third person mode there is a simple but inconvenient fix. When the camera lock happens

2) Deactivate third person with "1"

Now the camera should be unlocked

Alternatively you can disable the mod through the in game mod menus.
