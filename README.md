Epic>  Drive Letter:\Epic Games\Cyberpunk 2077\archive\pc\mod

![](https://i.imgur.com/XnDSRqR.png)[HARDCORE44 - Realistic Combat Overhaul - Adjusted Difficulty](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4325?tab=posts) by [radj307](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/users/5671914)  ***(OPTIONAL)***  NPCs do **much** more damage, especially at higher levels.

This is not for the faint of heart if you aren't the type to learn from your mistakes and change your approach, then this isn't the mod for you.
**You will die, and you will die often.**

### **How to use**

⛔ This mod should be used a on a new playthrough.                                                                                                                                                              ⛔ Set the difficulty to Very Hard.
⛔ Dont enable the mod if you are playing an existing save unless you plan on keeping it enabled. As it can cause leveling issues.
⛔ If you do disable the mod change your difficulty level in game from Very Hard to Hard.

### Things you need to know

- Don't worry about the levels on items, they are irrelevant. You don't need to upgrade anything, you can equip all weapons and clothing at level 1.
- Use god mode to get through the car chase scenes early on in the game.
- Beat on the Brat Street fighting quest is very difficult. 
- Intro car ride ambushes are impossible. I recommend disabling the mod in Vortex.
- Delamain's **"ambush"** quest is almost impossible but can be done.

The early game is very difficult and it will test your patience.
