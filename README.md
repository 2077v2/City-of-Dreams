 (OPTIONAL)   
Most mods have in-game settings so you can set the difficulties as you wish for an easier or more challenging experience.
HARDCORE44 - Realistic Combat Overhaul - Adjusted Difficulty by radj307 NPCs do much more damage, especially at higher levels. This is not for the faint of heart if you aren't the type to learn from your mistakes
and change your approach, then this isn't the mod for you.
You will die, and you will die often.
To take advantage of this mod read the following guide.
Set the difficulty to Very Hard.
Don't worry about the levels on items, they are irrelevant. You don't need to upgrade anything, you can equip all weapons and clothing at level 1.
Use god mode to get through the car chase scenes early on in the game. Alternatly you can just disable this mod in Vortex when you need to.
You may find the following Quests difficult.
Beat on the Brat Street fighting quest is very difficult. 
Intro car ride ambushes are impossible. I recommend disabling the mod in Vortex.
Delamain's "ambush" quest is almost impossible but can be done.
The early game is very difficult and it will test your patience.
If you don't like this mod disable it in Vortex.
